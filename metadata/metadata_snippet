Non-pathogenic strain MG1655 approximates wild-type E. coli as it has been maintained with very little genetic manipulation except for the curing (removal) of bacteriophage lambda and the F plasmid. MG1655 was derived from strain W1485, which was derived by Joshua Lederberg from the original K-12 isolate obtained from a patient in 1922.
